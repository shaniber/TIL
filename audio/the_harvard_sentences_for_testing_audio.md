# The Harvard Sentences for testing audio

## Context
I wanted to test the quality of my Jabra mic and needed something to read, which led me to the Harvard Sentences.

## TIL
The Harvard Sentences consist 72 lists of 10 English language phrases each. They're intended to use phenomes at the same frequency that they occur in English. For example:

```
List 34

    1.  Nine rows of soldiers stood in line.
    2.  The beach is dry and shallow at low tide.
    3.  The idea is to sew both edges straight.
    4.  The kitten chased the dog down the street.
    5.  Pages bound in cloth make a book.
    6.  Try to trace the fine lines of the painting.
    7.  Women form less than half of the group.
    8.  The zones merge in the central part of town.
    9.  A gem in the rough needs work to polish.
    10. Code is used when secrets are sent.
```

So you've got a nifty little set of sentences that you can use to hit all of the English sounds, and you don't have to think about writing something yourself.
