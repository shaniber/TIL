# Switching layouts on Logitech keyboards

## Context
When setting up a bunch of workstations at `${JOB}`, I needed to switch the new Logitech keyboards to "Mac" layout. 

## TIL
The keyboards (or maybe the receivers?) have some handy-dandy functions built into the keyboard to swap layouts and do a few other things.

* `fn` + `O` - swaps PC layout to Mac layout
* `fn` + `P` - swaps Mac layout to PC layout
* `fn` + `esc` - swaps between media keys and F1-12 keys

To activate the key combo, press and hold the sasociated keys for **3 seconds**. There's some other combos, but these are the ones that I needed.
