# Importing iCal events to Google Calendar

## Context
I signed up for an event that provided me an iCal entry, and wanted to add it to my Google Calendar.

## TIL
When signing up for an Apple event, they offered the option to add the event to my calendar by downloading an iCal event file (a `.ics` file). 

To add it into my calendar, I followed these steps:

1. Click the cog wheel, then click **Settings**.
2. In the sidebar menu, click **Import & Export**.
3. Click **Select from your computer**, and select the downloaded iCal event file (i.e. `imporant_event.ics`).
4. Select the calendar to add it to.
5. Click **Import**. 

And voila, it's now in your calendar.
