# Use a custom font in Slack

## Context
I wanted to change my font in Slack to something other than supported fonts.

## TIL
You can set a non-standard font using the following slash command:

```
/slackfont Full Font Name
```

You'll need the _full_ font name in order to use it:

```
/slackfont Brush Script MT
```

When you realise that you've made a terrible mistake, you can reset the font with just the bare slash command:

```
/slackfont
```
