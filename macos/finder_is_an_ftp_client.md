# Finder is an FTP client

## Context
While exploring an FTP search tool on the web, I discovered that Finder can be used as an FTP client.

## TIL
I found a link to an [anonymous FTP search tool on the web](http://archie.macdomain.net/) (via [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/gmh1nw/archie_anonymous_ftp_search_revival) (famously called [Archie](https://web.archive.org/web/19980203091448/http://www.bunyip.com/products/archie/)), and discovered quite by accident that you can use the macOS Finder as an FTP client. Firefox happily let me choose it to connect to a remove server. 

To manually connect:

1) With Finder in the foreground, select **Go** » **Connect to Server** (or press **⌘-K**).  
2) Enter the address of the server (for example [ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net](ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net)), and click **Connect**.  
3) Click **Connect** on the warning pop up.  
4) If this is an ftp server that allows anonymous connections, click **Guest**. Otherwise enter your username and password. Click **Connect**.  

Et voilà, Chicken Marengo Napoleon!
