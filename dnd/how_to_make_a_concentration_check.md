# How to make a concentration check

## Context
Almost every time I play D&D, I need to look up how to make a spellcasting concentration check. 

## TIL
There's not such thing as a "concentration check", per se. It's a Constitution saving throw, where the DC is 10, or half the damage you take, whichever is higher. You need to make a separate saving throw for each different damage source. If you use the 2024 rules, the max DC is 30.
