# Find the date of an xkcd comic

## Context
I wanted to find the date of an xkcd comic from a ways in the past. 

## TIL
Randall Monroe doesn't publish the dates on his comics, but he does publish a JSON file for each comic that contains useful and interesting meta-data. You can read it by appending `info.0.json` to the URL for a comic. 

For example, if I wanted to find the date of the [Dependency comic (#2347)](https://xkcd.com/2347/), I could go to the following URL:

> [https://xkcd.com/2347/info.0.json](https://xkcd.com/2347/info.0.json)

And voila, I can see that it was published August 8th, 2020. Neat!
